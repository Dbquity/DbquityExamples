    class Period
        description:
            This Period class comprises the Start, Days and End fields to
            capture an interval of a certain number of days starting and ending
            at certain dates.
            It uses the invariant property to declare the formula that ties
            together these three fields.
        date Start                  # initializes to today() by default
        integer Days
        date End
            initialization: nil     # works well with the invariant
                                    # ('nil' means: no value has been entered)
        # when a user changes one value, Dbquity seeks to update another as
        # needed to satisfy the invariant
        invariant:                                    
            Start + Days = End and Start <= End
